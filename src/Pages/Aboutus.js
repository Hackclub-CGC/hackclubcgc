            About HackClub CGC:-
"Alone, we can do so little together, we can do so much" - Helen Keller
Pioneered by three visionary students who wanted better for their fellow coders, HC CGC is one of its kind. 
We are a group of people pooling our skills to help out each other and ultimately grow together. 
"We're at our best when we are making" is our motto. All you need to join the club is a learning attitude. 
We are by the coders and for the coders.
